# QuantumClassical-GEFYRA (QC-GEFYRA): Materials Modeling and Electronic Calculations Based on Classical Simulations and Experimental Data

In Greek gefyra means bridge. The main usage of this program is to use atomic configurations obtained from classical simulations results (or experimental data) to calculate  quantum mechnical (electronic) properties via tight-binding formulation. In a sense, the program 'bridges' the classical and quantum world.
