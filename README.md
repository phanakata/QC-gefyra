# QuantumClassical-GEFYRA (QC-GEFYRA): Materials Modeling and Electronic Calculations Based on Classical Simulations and Experimental Data

In Greek, geyfra ($\gamma\epsilon\phi\rho\alpha$) means bridge. The main usage of this program is to use atomic configurations obtained from classical simulations results (or experimental data) to calculate  quantum mechnical (electronic) properties via tight-binding formulation. In a sense, the program 'bridge' the classical and quantum world.
